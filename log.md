# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn python, Practiced three questions in codewars but none passed tests, learnt basics of flask

**Thoughts:** I faced a challenge when solving katas in codewars, I think i have to improve in this area. I found chatGPT to be a useful tool for explaining concepts
